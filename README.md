# SYATracker-PowerSchool
My first plugin created for PowerSchool (SIS)


This plugin has been created to help integrate the Saskatchewan Youth Apprenticeship Program data into PowerSchool for 
tracking and reporting purposes. The goal is to eventually have this information span all three portals (Admin, Teacher, and Parent) 
to ensure that everyone has access to the information being tracked. This module will help to ensure that the data follows the student 
(should they transfer internally; previously recorded on paper) while allowing for an increase in discussion and communication of the 
students progress via multiple parties.
